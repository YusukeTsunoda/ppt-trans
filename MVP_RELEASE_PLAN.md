# 🚀 MVP Release Plan - PPTTranslatorApp

**Created**: 2025-08-25  
**Target Release**: MVP (Minimum Viable Product)  
**Timeline**: 3-5 days

## 🎯 MVP Goal
Deploy a functional PowerPoint translation application with core features working, deferring non-critical improvements to post-launch.

## 📋 Priority 1: CRITICAL BLOCKERS (Day 1-2)
**Must fix to deploy**

### 1.1 Fix TypeScript Compilation (127 errors)
- [ ] **Fix module exports** (30+ files)
  ```bash
  # Files needing export statements:
  src/app/upload/page.tsx
  src/components/ThemeToggle.tsx
  src/app/actions/auth.ts
  src/components/ui/Button.tsx
  ```
  
- [ ] **Add missing type definitions**
  ```typescript
  // src/types/activity.ts
  interface Activity {
    description?: string;
    // ... other properties
  }
  ```

- [ ] **Create missing modules**
  ```bash
  # Create these files or fix imports:
  src/lib/security/xssProtection.ts
  src/lib/translation/translator.ts
  ```

### 1.2 Fix Test Environment Issues
- [ ] **Update test files** - Replace direct process.env assignments
  ```typescript
  // Before: process.env.NODE_ENV = 'test'
  // After: Use jest.replaceProperty() or similar
  ```

- [ ] **Fix RateLimiter test imports**
  ```typescript
  // Ensure checkLimit method exists or update tests
  ```

### 1.3 Verify Build Success
- [ ] Run `npm run type-check` - Must pass with 0 errors
- [ ] Run `npm run build` - Must complete successfully
- [ ] Generate production bundle

## 📋 Priority 3: PRODUCTION READY (Day 3-4)
**Deployment requirements**

### 3.1 Environment Configuration

  NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
  ```

### 3.2 Security Checks

- [ ] Lighthouse score > 70
- [ ] First paint < 3 seconds

### 3.4 Deployment Setup
- [ ] Configure Vercel/hosting platform
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Configure domain and SSL

- [ ] Remove unused variables
- [ ] Clean up console.logs

### 4.2 Testing
- [ ] Fix E2E test authentication
- [ ] Add 5 more unit tests
- [ ] Set up test coverage reporting

### 4.3 Documentation

## 🚫 NOT FOR MVP (Post-Launch)
**Explicitly defer these items**

- ❌ 100% test coverage (current: 10%)
- ❌ React performance optimizations (useMemo, useCallback)
- ❌ Remaining TODO comments in E2E tests
- ❌ API versioning
- ❌ Advanced monitoring (beyond basic Sentry)
- ❌ Internationalization
- ❌ Advanced caching strategies
- ❌ PWA features

---

## 📊 Success Metrics for MVP

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### If TypeScript fixes take longer than expected:
1. Focus on fixing only build-blocking errors
2. Use `@ts-ignore` sparingly for non-critical issues
3. Document technical debt for later resolution

### If deployment fails:
1. Have rollback plan ready
2. Deploy during low-traffic hours
3. Keep previous working version accessible

### If core features don't work:
1. Disable broken features with feature flags
2. Show "coming soon" messages
3. Focus on getting one complete flow working

## ✅ MVP Completion Checklist

**Before declaring MVP ready:**
- [ ] Build completes without errors
- [ ] All Priority 1 items complete
- [ ] All Priority 2 items complete
- [ ] Manual testing of critical paths done
- [ ] Production environment configured
- [ ] Deployment successful to staging
- [ ] Stakeholder approval received

**Launch criteria met when:**
- Users can complete the basic flow: Sign up → Upload → Translate → Download

## 📝 Notes

**Remember for MVP:**
- Perfect is the enemy of good
- Focus on "working" not "optimal"
- Document shortcuts taken for later fix
- User feedback will guide post-MVP priorities

**Post-MVP Priority:**
1. Improve test coverage
2. Optimize performance
3. Enhance UI/UX based on feedback
4. Add advanced features
